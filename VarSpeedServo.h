  Function slowmove and supporting code added 2010 by Korman. Above limitations apply
  to all added code, except for the official maintainer of the Servo library. If he,
  and only he deems the enhancment a good idea to add to the official Servo library,

  this version of the library.

/*
  Updated 2013 by Philip van Allen (pva), 
  -- updated for Arduino 1.0 +
  -- consolidated slowmove into the write command (while keeping slowmove() for compatibility
     with Korman's version)
  -- added wait parameter to allow write command to block until move is complete
  -- added sequence playing ability to asynchronously move the servo through a series of positions, must be called in a loop

  
  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method

  Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are disabled when the first servo is attached.
  Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two timers, 48 servos will use four.
  The sequence used to sieze timers is defined in timers.h

  The methods are:

   VarSpeedServo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.

   attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
   attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
   default min is 544, max is 2400  
 
   write(value)     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
   write(value, speed) - speed varies the speed of the move to new position 0=full speed, 1-255 slower to faster
   write(value, speed, wait) - wait is a boolean that, if true, causes the function call to block until move is complete

   writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds 
   read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
   readMicroseconds()  - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
   attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
   detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin. 

   slowmove(value, speed) - The same as write(value, speed), retained for compatibility with Korman's version

   stop() - stops the servo at the current position

   sequencePlay(sequence, sequencePositions); // play a looping sequence starting at position 0
   sequencePlay(sequence, sequencePositions, loop, startPosition); // play sequence with number of positions, loop if true, start at position
   sequenceStop(); // stop sequence at current position
